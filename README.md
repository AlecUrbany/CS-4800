# Music Recommendation via Sentiment Analysis

Project Specifics:
Create a music recommendation software using Spotify API and a Large Language Model. The software will prompt the user, asking for a sentence to describe how they are feeling. The LLM will be able to parse out sentiment from the user-generated answer. From the sentiment, the program will recommend songs.
